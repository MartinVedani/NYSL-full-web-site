In this module, I was an independent contractor who develops custom websites for small organizations. The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) hired me to develop a website for their soccer teams. I worked on this website on my own and learnt to use modern HTML and CSS to produce an attractive, informative multi-page website based on the client's requirements.

To do this, I work through a series of tasks designed by experts in programming and web development to help me create a robust and useful website, and to reflect real challenges that arise during the website development process, specifically:

i.) Gathering the information to display on the website.

ii.) Deciding on a look and feel for the website.

iii.) Coding the web pages using HTML and CSS.

iv.) Validating that the HTML and CSS coding is correct and follows industry standards.

v.) Testing that the web pages work as specified, on multiple browsers.
