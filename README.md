# NYSL Full Web site 
MindHub 1. - NYSL full web site is published at https://martinvedani.github.io/NYSL-full-web-site/.


In this module, I was an independent contractor who develops custom websites for small organizations. The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) hired me to develop a website for their soccer teams. I worked on this website on my own and learnt to use modern HTML and CSS to produce an attractive, informative multi-page website based on the client's requirements.

To do this, I work through a series of tasks designed by experts in programming and web development to help me create a robust and useful website, and to reflect real challenges that arise during the website development process.
